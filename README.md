# maze-game

To start locally, simply run './go.sh' in your terminal.  This assumes you are running bash.
Note: This simply compiles the app and starts up a new google-chrome window pointing at the generated code.

Alternately, in one terminal window, use:
  bash
  source ./my-env.sh
  cd game
  npm run build
  npm run serve

And then open up a browser, and navigate to: "http://localhost:3000/index.html"

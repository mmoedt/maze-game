Step 1: Read instructions clearly to understand the scope and the requirements

-> There are a number of bonus options,
   so we want an iterative approach and get the basics running first,
   then add features as time permits

-> First thing I want to do is get the dev infrastructure set up;
   don't want to fail at the end because this is holding me up
   - I haven't used github actions before, but this should be simple, and have easy to find examples
   - It looks like it's a fully client-side react app to start, so it's just hosting some static files

- I haven't programmed any games like this in the past, but it seems simple enough that I should be able to accomplish this

-> took notes and noted thoughts while going through the instructions..


Step 2: a. Set up code project in github, b. set up basic react app, c. get it deployable

- found https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart
- created repo in my github account
- creating basic script to run locally, with basic html page target (not yet generating)

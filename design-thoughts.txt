Step 1: Read instructions clearly to understand the scope and the requirements

-> There are a number of bonus options,
   so we want an iterative approach and get the basics running first,
   then add features as time permits

-> First thing I want to do is get the dev infrastructure set up;
   don't want to fail at the end because this is holding me up
   - I haven't used github actions before, but this should be simple, and have easy to find examples
   - It looks like it's a fully client-side react app to start, so it's just hosting some static files

- I haven't programmed any games like this in the past, but it seems simple enough that I should be able to accomplish this

-> took notes and noted thoughts while going through the instructions..


Step 2: a. Set up code project in github, b. set up basic react app, c. get it deployable

- found https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart
- created repo in my github account
- creating basic script to run locally, with basic html page target (not yet generating)
-> first push to repo; verified I can update the repo and an initial script (mentioned in README) works fine

b. basic react app..  using: npx create-react-app ${APP_NAME} --template typescript

* I want to use a project-local version of node.js, instead of relying on whatever I have installed by default on my system
so, setting up environment..
- It looks like ES13 is also ES2022; so a recent (but maybe not most current) version of node.js and all the tooling would be appropriate
  I'll go with node.js v20; if it's older, it should still be compatible with newer javascript versions
- I'll also go with Typescript off the bat, since it should help catch bugs and I'm familiar with it
  - I've used a script, for personal learning projects, to set this up before; so I'll just borrow that (see my-env.sh)
  -> updating ./go.sh

Note: It shows "Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts with cra-template-typescript..."

-> There are lots of warning type messages about deprecated modules .. maybe running again with a newer node.js version makes sense..? (or newer create-react-app?)
-> re-created react project, less warnings. Still has an error / warning, but I will ignore for the sake of time.  I would want to address this soon for real work

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore.

"The project was built assuming it is hosted at /"
"You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json."

# This will be different between a deployed version and a locally-running version ..
This will need to be taken care of at some point; let's get locally working first

- The build notes using "serve -s build" to run on localhost as well, with default port 3000.
  Also found a note online about using a relative path for "homepage"; trying with that
  -> Seems to work fine! Gives me a react welcome page

-> auto-updating doesn't seem to work, I'm not sure if that's expected.  I'm fine with rerunning the server after updates

-> Okay, accomplished: - Should be able to run locally without the first dev's help

- Idea: For testing while developing, I want to make sure I'm representing the map correctly and navigation and orientation is working
  - So I want to get a 2d map working *first*, before the 3d rendering aspect, to speed up basic development
     despite it being an optional feature as a mini-map, I think this will really help me develop this

-> okay, the 2d minimap is starting to take too long, and it's not part of required functionality, so I'm going to abandon this effort!
  - it's best to go through the canvas docs and start rendering routines for the walls that are visible (start with just the current room first)

Thoughts..
  - Need to be able to set up a canvas and draw lines using the specified start and end coordinates ..
    - just draw based on a set of if or case statements, based on which directions are available

- react-canvas-draw doesn't seem to fit at all what I want.. looking at the demo page, it doesn't show any line drawing
- I found a simple example project at: https://stackblitz.com/edit/draw-line-canvas-react?file=index.js
  which might not be ideal, but should work to start with
